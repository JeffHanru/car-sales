## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Youâ€™ll need Node.js version `10.13` or later, a text editor and terminal app for this task.

- Git clone this repo
- Navigate to the `car-sales` directory in your terminal
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the development server `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and you should see a blank page.

You can also open [http://localhost:3000/api/listings](http://localhost:3000/api/listings) with your browser and see the response from the API endpoint (the results are a randomised number of listings, and order).
